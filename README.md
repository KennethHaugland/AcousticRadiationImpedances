This project contains radiation impedances of many of the most used radiators in acoustics.

Calcualtions of radiation impedance from circular, elliptical and rectangular objects in baffel as well as field-excited radiation impedance of strip and rectangular openings. It is stable for all values of interest to an acoustician.

The package also contains implementation of the Struve function within 9 decimal accuarcy for any order and real argument z between 0 - 50 000, as well as the implementation of the complete and incomplite elliptic integrals to 15 digits accuracy.

Some of this code is explained here:
